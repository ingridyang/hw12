Light Show
    
    Light that is sensored through sound

Summary
Will be building a sensored LED light that is controlled by sound. So when someone claps, the light will react to that sound. 

Any sound that is detected through a sensor and react 

Component Parts
Describe the components, or pieces, that make up your project.

Include what types of inputs/outputs/data it will use. You can also upload an image with a diagram showing how all those pieces are connected.

When your project is completed, you will then add the following sections:

Timeline 
Week 0: Write Proposal
Week 1: Prototype
Week 2: Prototype
Week 3: Refine/Re-adjust
Week 4: Present!

Challenges
  Figuring out how to make it look presentable and figuring out how to connect multiple lights together and have a delay.

Completed Work
** (Upload photos and videos of your completed final project!) **

Code 
    int soundsensor = 3;
    int led = 7;

    void setup() {

        pinMode (soundsensor, INPUT);
        pinMode (led, OUTPUT);

    }

    void loop() {

        int sensorvalue = digitalRead (soundsensor);
  
        if (sensorvalue == 1)
        {
        digitalWrite (led, HIGH);
     }

    else
        {
        digitalWrite (led, LOW);
      }
    }
